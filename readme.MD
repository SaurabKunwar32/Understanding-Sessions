# 📘 Session Handling Project

This is a simple project I built while learning how **sessions** are actually created and managed in a web application.

It helped me understand how:

- Session IDs are generated and stored
- Data is preserved across multiple requests
- User-specific information is maintained during a browsing session

## 🔍 What I Explored

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- 🔧 How sessions work behind the scenes
- 📄 Preserving data across different pages
- 🍪 The role of cookies in managing session IDs
- 🛠️ Basic session setup using backend tools like **Node.js** and **Express**
